# User-Facing Packages

This page indexes README-only user-facing package CLIs and features that need root docs coverage beyond package-local READMEs/manifests.

## Root-docs policy

- **Include** root docs coverage for package-local CLIs, extension features, dashboards, and benchmark runners that users can run directly or through `omp`.
- **Exclude explicitly** when a package/crate is internal implementation only; point to the architecture doc that owns it.
- Package READMEs and manifests remain the source of truth for package-local setup and flags; root docs make the feature discoverable and link to exact source paths.
- Internal Rust crates remain covered by native architecture docs unless promoted as standalone user-facing commands or APIs. The contributor-facing map lives at [`native-crates.md`](./native-crates.md); today every `crates/*` entry is internal to `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives` and the embedded shell, so [`natives-architecture.md`](./natives-architecture.md) and the surrounding native docs own them.

## Package CLIs and features

### `packages/stats` — local usage dashboard

Sources: [`packages/stats/README.md`](../packages/stats/README.md), [`packages/stats/package.json`](../packages/stats/package.json), [`packages/coding-agent/src/cli/stats-cli.ts`](../packages/coding-agent/src/cli/stats-cli.ts).

- Package: `@oh-my-pi/omp-stats`; bin: `omp-stats`; main user path: `omp stats`.
- Feature: local observability dashboard for AI usage statistics from session JSONL logs.
- CLI modes: `omp stats` starts or reuses the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:3847`, opens it in the browser, and keeps running. `--port <port>` changes the port; `--host <host>` changes the bind address (loopback by default). `--summary` prints a console summary; `--json` prints JSON and exits. The standalone `omp-stats` uses `--sync` for its summary mode and does not automatically open a browser.
- Programmatic API: exports helpers such as `syncAllSessions()` and `getDashboardStats()` for embedding.
- Inputs/storage: scans the active profile's session directory recursively, including nested subagent transcripts; stores aggregates in that profile's stats database. Default paths are `~/.omp/agent/sessions/` and `~/.omp/stats.db`; initialized XDG data roots and named profiles change them through the shared directory resolver.
- Outputs: request/token/cost, provider, model, folder, tool, gain, and frustration dashboards. API endpoints include `/api/stats`, `/api/stats/models`, `/api/stats/folders`, `/api/stats/timeseries`, `/api/stats/tools`, `/api/stats/gain`, `/api/status`, `/api/events` (SSE), and `/api/sync` (POST).
- Side effects/limits: one-shot reports finish ingestion and rollups before printing. The dashboard binds immediately and starts background ingestion when a page connects to its event stream; `Ctrl+C` closes the CLI's stats database and exits. Frustration judging in `omp stats` lazily uses the configured `judge` role (telemetry purpose `stats_frustration`) and can make model calls; standalone `omp-stats` does not supply a judge.

### `packages/omptype` — schema validation library

Sources: [`packages/omptype/README.md`](../packages/omptype/README.md), [`packages/omptype/package.json`](../packages/omptype/package.json), and the repository [omptype authoring guide](./omptype-guide.md).

- Package: public `@oh-my-pi/omptype`; install with `bun add @oh-my-pi/omptype`. Its manifest declares Node 20 or newer and Bun 1.3.14 or newer.
- Feature: callable ArkType-compatible schemas with cheap interpreted startup, lazy hot-path compilation, validation errors, defaults and morphs, and JSON Schema emission.
- Public surfaces: `@oh-my-pi/omptype` for native authoring, `/typebox` and `/zod` for compatibility builders, and `/ark` for the alias-free ArkType compatibility facade.
- Runtime behavior: schema calls return the validated value or `type.errors`; `.assert()` returns the value or throws; `.allows()` performs a boolean check.
- Limits: this is an intentionally focused compatibility surface rather than a complete implementation of every ArkType, TypeBox, or Zod API.

### `packages/snapcompact` — bitmap context-compression API

Sources: [`packages/snapcompact/README.md`](../packages/snapcompact/README.md), [`packages/snapcompact/package.json`](../packages/snapcompact/package.json), [`packages/snapcompact/src/index.ts`](../packages/snapcompact/src/index.ts).

- Package: public `@oh-my-pi/snapcompact`; install with `bun add @oh-my-pi/snapcompact`; requires
  Bun 1.3.14 or newer.
- Feature: deterministic local serialization and PNG rendering of discarded conversation history
  for vision-model context compaction; no model call or API key is required.
- Public entrypoint includes `compact`, `render`, `renderMany`, `frames`, shape selection, text
  normalization/serialization, image budgets, and file-operation helpers.
- Runtime constraint: rasterization and PNG encoding require `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives`.
